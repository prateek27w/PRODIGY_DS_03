Task#3-: Analysed the given bank marketing dataset imported from UCI Machine Learning Repository, the classification goal of this task is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (term_deposit) variable. By performing data cleaning, data preprocessing and feature selection along with train-test split, the Decision Tree Classifier model has been built and evaluated the accuracy of the model which is around 89 % using both the criterion (gini) and entropy. Used different python libraries and functions to visualise data by charts, heatmaps and more to make data easy to understand and presentable.
