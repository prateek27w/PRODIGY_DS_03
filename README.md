Task#3-: Analysed the given bank marketing dataset imported from UCI Machine Learning Repository, the classification goal of this task is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (term_deposit) variable. By performing data cleaning, data preprocessing and feature selection along with train-test split, the Decision Tree Classifier model has been built and evaluated the accuracy of the model which is around 89 % using both the criterion (gini) and entropy. Imported different python libraries and functions such as sklearn module to visualise data by charts, treemaps and heatmaps to make data easy to understand and presentable.
